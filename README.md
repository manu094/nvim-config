My tailored Nvim config.

I joined the Neovim train pretty recently, so there is not an ounce of vimscript in this. Lua ftw!

The philosophy is that init.lua is only used as a way to require sub-files to reduce clutter.
All the rest (options, plugins, plugin options, keymaps, etc...) is ordered in its own file.
